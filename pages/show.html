			<p class="video">The theme song is an adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's poem <em>Sing me a Song of a Lad that is Gone</em>, set to the tune of the Scottish folk song "The Skye Boat Song", which alludes to Bonnie Prince Charlie escaping by boat after his defeat at Culloden during the last Jacobite rising in 1746. As locales and themes change throughout the different series, the language and instruments of the song are adapted to reflect the new environments of the show. This is the theme from the first season, which is focused entirely on Scotland, and therefore prominently features traditional Scottish instruments like the bagpipe.</p>
