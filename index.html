		<p class="synopsis">The Outlander franchise consists of a core book series, related novellas and comics, and a Starz television adaptation. At its heart, its main character is Claire Randall, a 20th century English nurse. At the seriesâ€™s start, Claire and her husband Frank are on their second honeymoon in Scotland, celebrating their reunion now that World War II has ended, and looking forward to settling into a life together. Mysteriously, however, she seems to stumble through a hole in time and finds herself in Scotland 200 years earlier, at the height of Highlander culture. In trying to navigate her surroundings and stay alive in a land not friendly to English citizens, she is torn between two husbands - one in 1946 and one in 1743, on the precipice of an attempted revolution that would end Highland life for the people she has come to love.</p> <!-- Seriously, it's so good. I'm excited about the story all over again just summarizing it. -->
